# NumPy Practice

This repository contains my **hands-on practice with NumPy**, the core Python library for numerical computing.  
NumPy is widely used in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Scientific Computing** because of its ability to handle **multi-dimensional arrays** and perform fast mathematical operations.

I created this repo to document my **learning journey** with NumPy and to have a structured place where I solve different problems step by step.

## ðŸ“Œ Why NumPy?

- Provides **N-dimensional arrays** (faster than Python lists)  
- Performs **vectorized operations** without explicit loops  
- Includes powerful tools for **indexing, slicing, reshaping**  
- Built-in methods for **mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra operations**  
- Serves as the **foundation for libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch**

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Each notebook in this repository focuses on one major concept:

1. **NumPy Introduction** â€“ Installing NumPy, basic syntax, arrays vs lists  
2. **Array Creation** â€“ `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, random arrays  
3. **Indexing & Slicing** â€“ Accessing elements, rows, columns, subarrays  
4. **Data Types (dtype)** â€“ Understanding types, type conversion, `.astype()`  
5. **Copy vs View** â€“ Memory management in NumPy arrays  
6. **Shape & Reshape** â€“ Changing dimensions of arrays  
7. **Iteration** â€“ Looping through arrays, using `nditer()`  
8. **Joining & Splitting** â€“ `hstack`, `vstack`, `concatenate`, `split`, `array_split`  
9. **Searching, Sorting, Filtering** â€“ Boolean indexing, `where()`, `sort()`, conditional filters  
10. **Combined Exercises** â€“ Solving problems that mix multiple concepts
